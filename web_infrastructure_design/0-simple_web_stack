## The server

It is generally located in a data center, in the form of a physical machine or a virtual machine

It contains an OS (Ubuntu for example) which allows
The server runs an operating system, such as Linux, which allows applications and services to run.

## DNS

The DNS translate a domain name into an IP address.
The record `www.foobar.com` is an A record because it resolves to an IPv4 address (8.8.8.8).

## Web server

The web server handle HTTP requests and serve static content (HTML, CSS...)

## Application server

The application server is responsible for computing dynamic content and executing the application logic.

## Database

The database stores the data, ( user information and persistent content..)

## Communication

The server communicates with the user’s computer using a network using TCP/IP.

## Limitations / issues

**Downtime :** The website would be temporarily unavailable during maintenance, such as when deploying new code that requires restarting the web server.

**SPOF :** This infrastructure has a single point of failure because all components are hosted on a single server and there is no redundancy.

**Scalabilité :** This infrastructure cannot scale and would not be able to handle traffic exceeding the server’s capacity.
