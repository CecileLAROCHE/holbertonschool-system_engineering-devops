## Overview

A user wants to access the website www.foobar.com
.
The request is resolved by DNS and then handled by a distributed web infrastructure designed to improve availability compared to a single-server setup.

## Servers and redundancy

This infrastructure uses two servers.
Each server contains:

a web server (Nginx),

an application server,

a set of application files (the code base),

a MySQL database.

Both servers are identical, which provides redundancy.
If one server fails, the other one can still handle incoming requests.

## Load balancer

A load balancer (HAProxy) is added in front of the two servers.
Its role is to distribute incoming traffic between the servers in order to improve availability and handle more requests than a single server could.

### Load balancing algorithm

The load balancer can be configured with a round-robin algorithm.
This algorithm distributes requests sequentially, sending each new request to the next available server.

### Active-Active setup

The load balancer is configured in an active-active setup.
This means that both servers actively handle traffic at the same time.

In contrast, in an active-passive setup, only one server handles requests while the second server remains idle and is used only if the first one fails.

## Database cluster (MySQL Master-Replica)

The databases are organized in a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster.
This cluster uses replication to keep data synchronized between the databases.

The Primary (Master) database node handles both read and write operations.
The Replica (Slave) database node only handles read operations and continuously replicates data from the Primary node.

The application writes data only to the Primary database to ensure data consistency.

## Issues and limitations

### Single Points of Failure (SPOF)

Even with two servers, this infrastructure still has single points of failure.
The load balancer itself is a SPOF, because there is only one load balancer and no redundancy for it.

### Security issues

There is no firewall protecting the servers, which exposes them directly to the internet and increases security risks.

Traffic between the user and the infrastructure is unencrypted because HTTPS is not configured, allowing sensitive data to potentially be intercepted.

## Monitoring

There is no monitoring system in place.
As a result, server failures or performance issues cannot be detected automatically.
